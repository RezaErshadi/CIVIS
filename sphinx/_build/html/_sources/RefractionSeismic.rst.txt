Refraction Seismic
=========

This is the content of the new page.

Introduction Seismic
---------
- Active (Seismics) and passive (Seismology)
- Example for seismology: interior structure of the Earth, Earthquake locations and mechanisms
- Example for deeper seismic: Traditionally oil & gas but now wind platforms (stability, anchoring)
- Application of shallower (ground-water, engineering type of questions ?)

Fundamental Concepts of seismic waves
---------
- 1D Seismic Wave Equation and propagation velocity
- Stress and strain (introducing elastic moduli e.g., Young, Bulk), (density paradox)
- Types of Seismic waves (body waves & surface waves)

Principles of Seismic Field Measurements
---------
- Seismic energy sources
- Detection and recording of seismic waves
- Source and Receiver Setup
- Data example of a single trace and a shot gather 
- Raypath geometry
    - Huygen’s Principle
    - Reflection and Refraction Laws (Snel’s Law)
    - Critical refraction
    - Headwave (Refracted Waves)
    - Raypath and Travel Times for Direct, Reflected, and Refracted Waves

Application in Mapping
---------
- Techniques for Mapping Layers with Refraction Seismic
    - 1D- Hidden layers
    - Phantoming
- Real-data Examples and Case Studies
