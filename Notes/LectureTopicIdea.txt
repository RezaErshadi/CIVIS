———
1. **Introduction Seismic:**
	⁃	Active  (Seismics) and passive (Seismology)
	⁃	Example for seismology: interior structure of the Earth, Earthquake locations and mechanisms
	⁃	Example for deeper seismic: Traditionally oil & gas but now windplatforms (stability, anchoring)
	⁃	Application of shallower (ground-water, engineering type of questions ?)

2. **Fundamental Concepts of seismic waves:**
	⁃	1D Seismic Wave Equation and propagation velocity
	⁃	Stress and strain (introduićing elastic moduli e.g., Young, Bulk),  (density paradox)
	⁃	Types of Seismic waves (body waves & surface waves)

3. **Principles of Seismic Field Measurements:**
	⁃	Seismic energy sources
	⁃	Detection and recording of seismic waves
	⁃	Source and Receiver Setup
	⁃	Data example of a single trace and a shot gather 

	⁃	Raypath geometry
	⁃	Huygen’s Principle
	⁃	Reflection and Refraction Laws (Snel’s Law)
	⁃	Critical refraction
	⁃	Headwave (Refracted Waves)
	⁃	Raypath and Travel Times for Direct, Reflected, and Refracted Waves

4. **Application in Mapping:**
   - Techniques for Mapping Layers with Refraction Seismic
	hidden layers
	phantoming
   - Real-data Examples and Case Studies
